To determine the type and amount of adulteration in a given substance using Image Processing.
Adulteration is one of largest prevailing problem in the world. Adulteration means addition of another substance to a food item in order to increase the quantity of the food item in raw form or prepared form, which may result in the loss of actual quality of food item that can even be dangerous to health. These substances may be other available food items or non-food items. Although several techniques are used to find the adulteration they are completely complex, inaccurate and testing varies from one substance to other. There are several adulterated food substances released into the market and people cannot identify it easily. People find it difficult while choosing the best food substance. They cannot rely on chemical or manual testing while buying products from a store/grocery. Hence a suitable device that can be used for finding out adulteration in almost all substances is essential.

I am developing a method to determine the type and amount of adulterant added to the substance using Raspberry pi, camera module and image processing technology.
